### Introduction: How to Build Quantum-Enhanced Smart Contracts on EpicChain

Building smart contracts with advanced quantum-resistant features and secure asset management capabilities on EpicChain requires a thorough understanding of both blockchain technology and Rust programming. This guide will walk you through the process of developing two key smart contracts for EpicChain: Quantum Guard Nexus and Quantum Vault Asset.

#### 1. **Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Install Rust and ink! Framework:**

1. **Install Rust:** Download and install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Follow the instructions for your operating system.

2. **Install ink! CLI Tools:** The `ink!` framework is used for writing smart contracts in Rust. Install the ink! CLI tools using the following command:

   ```sh
   cargo install cargo-contract
   ```

**Create a New ink! Project:**

3. **Initialize a New Project:** Use the ink! CLI to create a new smart contract project:

   ```sh
   cargo contract new quantum_contracts
   cd quantum_contracts
   ```

#### 2. **Developing Smart Contracts**

**Quantum Guard Nexus Contract:**

The Quantum Guard Nexus smart contract provides quantum-resistant cryptographic operations and manages permissions for accessing sensitive data. Hereâ€™s how to build it:

1. **Define Storage and Constructor:**

   ```rust
   #[ink(storage)]
   #[derive(Default, SpreadLayout)]
   pub struct QuantumGuardNexus {
       owner: AccountId,
       data: String,
       permission: bool,
   }
   ```

   - `owner`: Stores the account ID of the contract owner.
   - `data`: Holds the sensitive data managed by the contract.
   - `permission`: Tracks whether access permission is granted.

2. **Implement Functions:**

   ```rust
   impl QuantumGuardNexus {
       #[ink(constructor)]
       pub fn new(initial_data: String) -> Self {
           Self {
               owner: Self::env().caller(),
               data: initial_data,
               permission: false,
           }
       }

       #[ink(message)]
       pub fn set_data(&mut self, new_data: String) {
           self.ensure_owner();
           self.data = new_data;
           self.permission = true; // Grant permission after data update
       }

       #[ink(message)]
       pub fn get_data(&self) -> String {
           if !self.permission {
               panic!("Permission denied");
           }
           self.data.clone()
       }

       #[ink(message)]
       pub fn grant_permission(&mut self, granted: bool) {
           self.ensure_owner();
           self.permission = granted;
       }

       #[ink(message)]
       pub fn revoke_permission(&mut self) {
           self.ensure_owner();
           self.permission = false;
       }

       fn ensure_owner(&self) {
           if self.env().caller() != self.owner {
               panic!("Unauthorized access");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

**Quantum Vault Asset Contract:**

The Quantum Vault Asset contract is designed for secure asset management, including deposit, withdrawal, and transfer functionalities. Hereâ€™s how to build it:

1. **Define Storage and Data Structures:**

   ```rust
   #[ink(storage)]
   #[derive(Default, SpreadLayout)]
   pub struct QuantumVaultAsset {
       owner: AccountId,
       assets: HashMap<AccountId, u64>,
       transaction_log: HashMap<u64, TransactionRecord>,
       transaction_counter: u64,
   }

   #[derive(Debug, Clone, ink_storage::traits::SpreadLayout)]
   #[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo))]
   pub struct TransactionRecord {
       from: AccountId,
       to: AccountId,
       amount: u64,
       timestamp: u64,
   }
   ```

   - `owner`: Stores the account ID of the contract owner.
   - `assets`: A map tracking balances for each account.
   - `transaction_log`: A log of transactions for transparency.
   - `transaction_counter`: Counter for transaction IDs.

2. **Implement Functions:**

   ```rust
   impl QuantumVaultAsset {
       #[ink(constructor)]
       pub fn new() -> Self {
           Self {
               owner: Self::env().caller(),
               assets: Default::default(),
               transaction_log: Default::default(),
               transaction_counter: 0,
           }
       }

       #[ink(message)]
       pub fn deposit(&mut self, amount: u64) {
           self.ensure_owner();
           let caller = Self::env().caller();
           let balance = self.assets.entry(caller).or_insert(0);
           *balance += amount;
       }

       #[ink(message)]
       pub fn withdraw(&mut self, amount: u64) {
           self.ensure_owner();
           let caller = Self::env().caller();
           let balance = self.assets.entry(caller).or_insert(0);
           if *balance < amount {
               panic!("Insufficient balance");
           }
           *balance -= amount;
       }

       #[ink(message)]
       pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: AccountId, amount: u64) {
           self.ensure_owner();
           let caller = Self::env().caller();
           let sender_balance = self.assets.entry(caller).or_insert(0);
           if *sender_balance < amount {
               panic!("Insufficient balance");
           }
           *sender_balance -= amount;
           let receiver_balance = self.assets.entry(to).or_insert(0);
           *receiver_balance += amount;

           // Log transaction
           self.transaction_counter += 1;
           self.transaction_log.insert(
               self.transaction_counter,
               TransactionRecord {
                   from: caller,
                   to,
                   amount,
                   timestamp: Self::env().block_timestamp(),
               },
           );
       }

       #[ink(message)]
       pub fn check_balance(&self) -> u64 {
           let caller = Self::env().caller();
           *self.assets.get(&caller).unwrap_or(&0)
       }

       #[ink(message)]
       pub fn get_transaction_log(&self) -> HashMap<u64, TransactionRecord> {
           self.transaction_log.clone()
       }

       fn ensure_owner(&self) {
           if self.env().caller() != self.owner {
               panic!("Unauthorized access");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

#### 3. **Building and Deploying the Contracts**

**Build the Contract:**

```sh
cargo +nightly contract build
```

**Deploy the Contract:**

Use EpicChainâ€™s deployment tools or similar interfaces to deploy the compiled contract to the network.

#### 4. **Testing the Contracts**

Write comprehensive test cases to verify the functionality of your smart contracts. Ensure you cover various scenarios and edge cases.

**Example Tests:**

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_set_data() {
        let mut contract = QuantumGuardNexus::new(String::from("Initial Data"));
        contract.set_data(String::from("Updated Data"));
        assert_eq!(contract.get_data(), String::from("Updated Data"));
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_permission_management() {
        let mut contract = QuantumGuardNexus::new(String::from("Sensitive Data"));
        contract.grant_permission(true);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_data(), String::from("Sensitive Data"));
        contract.revoke_permission();
        let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| contract.get_data());
        assert!(result.is_err());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_deposit_and_withdraw() {
        let mut contract = QuantumVaultAsset::new();
        contract.deposit(100);
        assert_eq!(contract.check_balance(), 100);
        contract.withdraw(50);
        assert_eq!(contract.check_balance(), 50);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_transfer_and_logging() {
        let mut contract = QuantumVaultAsset::new();
        let recipient = AccountId::from([0x1; 32]);
        contract.deposit(100);
        contract.transfer(recipient, 50);
        assert_eq!(contract.check_balance(), 50);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_transaction_log().len(), 1);
    }
}
```
