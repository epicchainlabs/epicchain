# **EpicChain Token Models Overview**

In the intricate web of EpicChain's ecosystem, tokens are more than mere digital assets; they are the vital essence that powers governance, transactions, and developments within the network. EpicChain introduces a dual-token model, uniquely crafted to cater to the distinct needs of governance and network utility. Let's embark on an exploration of **EpicChain** and **EpicPulse** tokens, alongside a dive into the EEP17 assets landscape.

## **Native Tokens**

EpicChain houses two native tokens, each serving fundamental roles within its vibrant ecosystem: **EpicChain** and **EpicPulse (EpicPulse)**.

### **EpicChain: The Governing Token**

- **Nature**: EpicChain stands as the governing heart of the network, enabling holders to actively participate in network management, including vital decisions such as voting for consensus nodes and modifying network parameters.
- **Supply**: The total supply of EpicChain tokens caps at 1 billion, a number set in stone and immortalized within the Genesis block.
- **Indivisibility**: Each EpicChain token is an undividable unit, ensuring straightforward and transparent governance.

### **EpicPulse: The Network's Lifeline**

- **Purpose**: EpicPulse serves as the indispensable fuel for the network, facilitating crucial operations such as transfers, asset registration, asset issuance, and DApp execution.
- **Granularity**: With a minimum unit of 0.00000001, EpicPulse allows for fine-grained transactions across the EpicChain.
- **Acquisition**: Users may acquire EpicPulse either through claiming processes or direct purchases, ensuring seamless engagement with network activities.

The Genesis block of EpicChain not only paves the path for the EpicChain token but also diligently mints the precise quantity of EpicPulse needed, mirroring the circulating supply on the legacy EpicChain network at the birth of the Genesis block.

## **EEP17 Assets: Tokenizing the Future**

Beyond the native tokens lies the realm of **EEP17 assets**, governed by the smart contract and accounted for within the contract's storage.

- **Creation & Management**: EEP17 tokens manifest through the wizardry of smart contracts. Each token's birth, lifecycle, and attributes are etched within the contract's storeroom.
- **Account Model**: The essence of EEP17 tokens is captured within an account model framework, allowing for meticulous management and seamless transactions within the EpicChain ecosystem.

For enthusiasts and developers eager to delve deeper into the EEP17 assets, the EEP-17 documentation becomes an invaluable grimoire, revealing the secrets of token issuance, management, and the infinite potentials they harbor within the EpicChain dynasty.
