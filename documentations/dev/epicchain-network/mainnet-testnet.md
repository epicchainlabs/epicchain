# Navigating the EpicChain Ecosystem: Main Net and Test Net

The EpicChain ecosystem, a canvas of endless possibilities, flourishes on the robust pillars of the **Main Net** and **Test Net**—each serving distinct roles in the blockchain universe. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a curious newcomer, understanding these networks' nuances is key to harnessing EpicChain's full potential.

## Main Net: The EpicChain Universe in Motion

The **Main Net** stands as the beating heart of EpicChain, a fully operational blockchain network officially launched to the digital world. It's where transactions are real, assets hold value, and the ecosystem thrives with genuine activity.

**Characteristics**:
- Officially launched and operational blockchain network.
- Transactions involve real EpicChain and EpicPulse tokens.
- Assets and operations here bear real-world value and consequences.

## Test Net: The Blockchain Playground

In contrast, the **Test Net** serves as a sandbox for creativity and experimentation:
- A dedicated environment for developing, debugging, and testing programs.
- Operations incur network fees in test EpicPulse, which holds no real value—ensuring a cost-free development experience.
- Test net tokens (EpicChain and EpicPulse) are freely obtainable for development purposes.

**Features**:
- Ideal for asset registration, distribution, and contract execution without financial stakes.
- A global network, accessible across the Internet.
- Features a blockchain explorer for conveniently tracking blocks, transactions, and more.
- Smart contracts on the test net are globally invokable.
- Not suitable for real commercial applications due to its non-commercial nature.

## Acquiring Test EpicPulse and Test EpicChain

Developers can claim Test EpicChain and EpicPulse on the Test Net using the following methods:

### Automatic Test Coin Acquisition:
- **NGD Faucet**: Request up to 500 EpicPulse per day via the NGD faucet.

### Manual Application via EpicChain Website:
- **For Larger Amounts**: Fill out the application on the [EpicChain Test Coin Application Page](https://EpicChain.org/testcoin/apply) for amounts exceeding the daily NGD faucet limit.

**Application Steps**:
1. **Find Your Public Key**: Your address and public key are distinct; ensure you use the public key, viewable when accessing the private key section.
2. **Complete the Form**: Remember to adjust the EpicChain Version to EpicChain N3 when applying.
3. **Receive and Utilize the Multi-party Signed Address**: Follow the instructions received via email to access the assets using your EpicChain-gui or CLI.

## Alternatives to Test Net

Prior to deploying smart contracts on the live network, leveraging the Test Net for comprehensive testing is prudent. However, during the early stages of development, employing alternative methods such as setting up a private chain can offer tailored testing environments. For insights into establishing a private chain, explore the guide on [Setting up a Private Chain](https://EpicChain.org/private-chain-setup).

Embarking on your development journey within the EpicChain ecosystem, the interplay between the Main Net and Test Net offers a dynamic landscape for innovation, testing, and deployment. Navigate wisely, and let your blockchain creations flourish.
