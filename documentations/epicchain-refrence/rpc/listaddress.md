The `listaddress` method is a useful tool within the blockchain ecosystem, enabling users to retrieve a comprehensive list of all addresses contained within the currently opened wallet. This functionality is particularly essential for managing and auditing wallet contents, ensuring users have immediate access to their addressesâ€”both for sending transactions and for monitoring purposes.

## Prerequisites

- **RpcServer Plugin**: This method requires the RpcServer plugin to be installed on your blockchain node. The plugin facilitates the node's ability to handle JSON-RPC requests.
  
- **Open Wallet**: Prior to invoking `listaddress`, the `openwallet` RPC method must be utilized to unlock the wallet. This step is mandatory to access and list the wallet's addresses.

## Parameters Description

- **No parameters required**: The `listaddress` method does not necessitate any parameters, simplifying the process of querying wallet addresses.

## Example Usage

### Request Body

Here's how to structure a JSON-RPC request for listing all addresses in the currently open wallet:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "listaddress",
  "params": [],
  "id": 1
}
```

### Response Body

The response provides a detailed account of each address within the wallet, along with associated metadata:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": [
    {
      "address": "NikhQp1aAD1YFCiwknhM5LQQebj4464bCJ",
      "haskey": true,
      "label": null,
      "watchonly": false
    },
    {
      "address": "NgaiKFjurmNmiRzDRQGs44yzByXuSkdGPF",
      "haskey": true,
      "label": null,
      "watchonly": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response Description

- **address**: Indicates the unique identifier or location code for the wallet address in question.
- **haskey**: A boolean value stating whether a private key exists for this address within the wallet; critical for transactions and ownership.
- **label**: An optional label that may be assigned to the address for easier identification or organization purposes (null if not assigned).
- **watchonly**: Specifies whether the address is a watch-only address, denoting it's being monitored without access to the private key (useful for tracking purposes without ownership).

## Considerations

- **Security**: As the `listaddress` method involves accessing sensitive wallet information, ensure that your node and wallet are secured against unauthorized access.
  
- **Wallet Management**: This method serves as a pivotal tool in wallet management workflows, enabling you to audit addresses, verify ownership, and organize your assets securely.

The `listaddress` method offers a streamlined, effective way for users and wallet managers to maintain oversight over their wallet addresses, bolstering both organizational and security protocols within their blockchain operations.
